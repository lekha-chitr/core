Today I have started the programme of cleaning the ghats. The social organizations of this place have assured me that the ghat will be cleaned within a month. After many years, I understand that this gift of cleanliness would be a unique one. Today, I have started and carried forward this task of cleaning the ghats in my constituency of Varanasi. I will nominate 9 people. As per our programme, after cleaning the ghats each person will nominate nine other persons. When I started the cleanliness drive in Delhi I had nominated nine people. Today again I will nominate nine people specially associated with Uttar Pradesh. One is the Chief Minister of UP Shri Akhilesh ji Yadav. The Chancellor of The Handicapped University in Chitrakoot, Jagat Guru Swami Rambhadracharya ji. One of the famous Bhojpuri singer and also our MP from BJP who is also associated with this place Shri Manoj Tiwari ji. The one to earn his place in the literary world by writing the biography of Lord Krishna, respected Manu Sharma ji. Cricketer and an inspiration for the youth Shri Mohammad Kaif. Padmashree awardee and renowned Sanskrit scholar, Guru Devi Prasad Dwivedi ji. A gift from UP who has created a name for himself by his comedies, Sri Raju Srivastava ji. The present cricketing icon of the new generation, Sri Suresh Raina ji. Renowned singer with a distinct identity for his music and a son of Meerut, a singer well acclaimed, Sri Kailash Kher ji. I have nominated these nine people. I request them to take this cleanliness drive forward and they also nominate nine people under them and take this cycle ahead. Thank you very much to you all. (The original message was in Hindi, this is the English rendering. Original message remains the authoritative version)
