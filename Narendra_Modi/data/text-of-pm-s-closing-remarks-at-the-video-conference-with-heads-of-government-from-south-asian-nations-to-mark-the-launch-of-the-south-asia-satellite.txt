Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas can be the guiding light for action and cooperation in South Asia: PM Modi

Excellencies, I would like to thank each one of you for your words. Your thoughts echo the sentiment that is captured by today’s launch. The South Asia Satellite tells us that even the sky is not the limit when it comes to regional cooperation among like-minded countries.
"सबका साथ सबका विकास" can be the guiding light for action and cooperation in South Asia. And, a befitting way for us to achieve our shared priorities of economic prosperity for our people. And in this, you will find a strong and committed partner in India that truly believes in the strength of this choice and principle. Let me once again thank you all for joining me today to celebrate the launch of South Asia Satellite. And, also your strong and continuous support in making this vision a reality. In the end, I also wish all of us more such celebrations where we can rejoice in success of our common and collective efforts for regional growth and prosperity. Thank you. Thank you very much.
