First of all many congratulations to the people of Manipur,
Yesterday, the state government has completed one year under the leadership of chief minister Shri N. Biren Singh Ji. How the government is being run, how the work on development schemes is being done, what is the meaning of stability, what is the impact if both the state government and central government work together, today the answer for all these questions is being given by this grand image of Manipur.
The spark in your eyes and your happiness reveal that how well the state government has been performing. All of us are extremely grateful to you people for the way you people have turned up in such a large number from far flung areas to bless us.
I convey my sincere regards to the people of Manipur, to its administration and also to the state government for the work done and the achievements made in the last one year.
I remember that when I came here in the February last year then I had said that our state government will do that kind of work in 15 months which the Congress government had not done in the last 15 years. It is still three months short of the 15 months but a visible change can be seen in Manipur. The government of Biren Ji has changed the negativity that had crept in the society due to the policies and decisions of previous government. Be it law and order or be it corruption or transparency or be it the work related to infrastructure, the government of Manipur has been working at a rapid pace on all these fronts.
Friends,
Today, I have got the good opportunity to either publicly dedicate or start the schemes worth nearly Rs. 750 crore for the development of Manipur. These schemes are directly related to the dreams of youth of Manipur, directly related with their talent and employment, directly related to the empowerment of women and also with the connectivity in the region. I am confident that these schemes will take the development of the state to new heights.
Brothers and sisters,
Today, sports is just not confined to being a medium of entertainment or just a mean to stay healthy. This in itself is an industry. Today, it’s a full time career too. It has been an effort of our government to provide every facility to the youth of this country in addition to providing the modern training for sports. Given the talent and capabilities of millions of youth of the North-East, the central government had especially decided to establish a national sports university here with an investment of Rs. 500 crore. I am happy that two courses have started here from January this year. When the work on the campus, the foundation for which has been laid by me today, will be complete then it will further help in bringing out the sport related talent of the youth of this place and provide training to them.



Brothers and sisters,
Our government has been working with the determination to make the country a sporting super power. Recently we have launched a national programme for development of sports under the name of Khelo India. Every year up to Rs. 5 lakh will be spent on each of one thousand talented athletes who will be selected under the Khelo India programme. I also urge the youth of Manipur to take the maximum advantage of this scheme. We have also focussed on the identification and development of talent at school level. Recently Khelo India School Games were organised in Delhi under this scheme. I am happy that Manipur established its reputation in that as well and secured the fifth place in the medal tally. Manipur won 34 medals, including 13 gold medals, by leaving behind the large states of the country. I convey many congratulations to the youth of Manipur for this feat. Apart from Manipur, children from other NE states have also come out with excellent performances in these games.
Friends,
Today, another big project related to sports has been dedicated to public here. The first Multi Sports Complex of Manipur has now been handed over to the youth of the state.
Youths of the state will not only receive training in this Multi Sports Complex but they will also be able to organise good tournaments here.
Brothers and sisters,
Manipur is that state which has proved the concept of women empowerment through sports. The women players of the state have brought laurels for the country in the events like Olympics and Commonwealth Games. This state has given several champions like Mary Kom, Mirabai Chanu, Bombayla Devi, Laishram and Sarita Devi in the games like football, wrestling, boxing, weightlifting and archery.
Woman power in this state has always been a source of inspiration for the country. Today on this occasion, I salute the great revolutionary and daughter of the nation Rani Gaidinliu. I am also privileged to inaugurate today a park dedicated in her name.



Friends,  
Girls’ education is the foundation for women empowerment. Only sometime back the Central Government launched nationwide ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ Program. The Program has elicited nationwide positive results.   I am happy that the State government is working to reduce the problems faced by the girls in Hill and Tribal areas for their education. The state government has undertaken construction of a new hostel for girls in the tribal areas.   I am fortunate to inaugurate one such hostel today. Women in Manipur are proactively involved in areas ranging from farming to handicrafts.  An all Women Market was envisaged so that women do not face any hardship in selling their products. Manipur Government led by Shri Biren ji is getting such markets constructed in the entire state. I have just inaugurated one such market. I would request Shri Birenji to also popularize government e-market place in the state. This is a platform through which you can sell products to the government.  Women in Manipur can get huge benefit from this.  Today I also inaugurated 1000 Anganwadi Centers in the State. These centers will work as a medium for improving the health of thousands of Mothers and their babies.  
They will also benefit from the recently launched National Nutrition Mission on Women’s Day.  The objective of the Mission is to have a targeted approach on providing nutritious food, cleanliness, and vaccination.  
Doctors, Teachers and Nurses posted in remote and far flung areas of Hill Districts face many hardships due to lack of proper accomodation at their respective places of posting.  To address this problem, I have laid the foundation stone for construction of acomodation for teachers, Doctors and Nurses at 19 specified locations in hill and remote areas. I am sure this will go a long way in motivating medical personnel to render dedicated services to the people of these areas.  
Friends.  
Our Government’s vision for the North East has been ‘Transformation by Transportation.’ Our focus is on connectivity. Work is also in progress for connecting remote areas of Manipur by helicopter service. Government is also working on various road projects. I have also laid the foundation of an important road project today.  
Manipur has a lot to offer on the tourism front:  Forests and wildlife, blue hills, lush green valleys, picturesque tea gardens, and diverse culture. Highly educated English speaking youth in the region make for a perfect case for developing Manipur as a model tourist destination. If tapped well, the sector can emerge as the biggest employer in the region. 
I also laid the foundation stone for eco-tourism at CheiraoChing, which is a popular hill near Imphal.  The foundation stone for a Cave Tourism project has also been laid.  
Friends.  
I have always maintained that India’s growth story shall never be complete until the eastern part of our country progresses at par with the western part. The North-East can be the New Engine of India’s growth. We are addressing the special needs of the North East Region to enable growth parity with the rest of the country.   
Various Ministries have been providing special dispensation for the North East under their ongoing schemes. All Union Ministries are mandated to spend 10% of their budget in the region and the full utilization of this entitlement is the endeavour of my Government. I have mandated my Cabinet colleagues to regularly visit the region and take stock of schemes for their effective implementation.  Till date more than 200 such visits have taken place by the Union Ministers.  I have visited the North East more than 25 times in the last 4 years.  
The Central Government has given a huge thrust on improving the infrastructure in the region. In the last three years, on an average Rs.5,300 crore have been spent annually for development of Rail Network in the North East Region, which is two and half times of average spending in the previous 5 years. The Jiribam Station in Manipur was connected by the broad gauge rail network in 2016. I had flagged off the first passenger train to Jiribam in May 2016. Today, seven out of eight States of North Eastern India are connected by Rail Network. Projects are going on to connect the remaining State capitals including Imphal in North East to broad gauge network.  
 One of the highest bridges in the world having Pier height of 141 meter is being built on Jiribam-Imphal New Line Project. A tunnel of 11.55 km length on the same route will be another milestone feature of this project.  
At the beginning of 2014 the State had only 1200 kilometres of total declared length of National Highways.  But, in the last four years we have declared another 460 kilometres length of Roads as National Highways, which is an increase of 38%.  In next 3 to 4 years, the Central Government is going to invest about Rs.30,000 Crores for development of National Highways and other important roads in Manipur State.  
 Apart from constructing National Highways, we are also focusing on connecting rural habitations with main roads under Prime Minister Grameen Sadak Yojana. The Central Government has released more than Rs.1000 Crores in the last 4 years under this scheme to the state. We have connected 150 habitations during this period.  All these efforts are reflection of our commitment for developing road connectivity in the State.  
The Union Government has approved a new Central Sector Scheme of “North East Special Infrastructure Development Scheme.” This will fill up gaps in creation of infrastructure in specified sectors.  



Friends,
I had urged all the Directors General of Police during their 2014 Annual Conference held in Guwahati to broad base police recruitment. Accordingly, in order to maintain cosmopolitan character of Delhi Police, we have taken steps to increase the number of Police Personnel from the North East Region. I am happy to share that 438 candidates including 136 female candidates from North East States have joined Delhi Police in 2016. Of these, 49 candidates are from Manipur State.
Recently, Government of India has sanctioned ten India Reserve Battalions for North Eastern States which include two battalions for Manipur. These two battalions will directly provide job opportunities to about 2,000 youth in the State.
We have established an administration that is citizen-centric and, we have started the process of regular and structured interaction with the public. These interactions were unheard of in the history of Manipur. “Meeyamgi Numit” and “Hill Leaders’ Day” are efforts in this direction. I am told, 24 such interactions have happened in which more than 19 thousand people have met the Chief Minister.
I am told, that the State Government is taking public grievances very seriously. A Grievance Cell has also been set up in the Chief Minister’s Office with a toll free number.
The ‘Go to Hills’ initiative of the Government is a welcome step. The Chief Minister with his entire cabinet has also travelled to all the hill districts to take the Government closer to the people.
Once Manipur decides something, no force can prevent it from happening. In April 1944, it was in this land of Manipur that Netaji Bose's INA gave the clarion call for freedom. It energised the nation and gave much needed strength to the freedom struggle.
Today, Manipur has decided to play a important role in the rise of a New India. In the last one year, Manipur has demonstrated what politics of development and good governance truly is.
Friends,
The love that you people bestowed on us a year ago that today we are able to do all these things.
I would like to assure you people that the team of Shriman N. Birensingh Ji will continue to get to full cooperation from my side.
Once again I congratulate the state government for completing one year and to the people of the state and especially the youth of the state for these projects of development.
Once again thank you very much to all of you.
Mayamaboo,
Thagat-Chari.
