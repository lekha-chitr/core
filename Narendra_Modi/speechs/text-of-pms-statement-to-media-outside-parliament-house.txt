The Winter Session of the Parliament is starting today. In this cool environment, we will do good work in the interest of the nation with a cool temperament, such is my hope.
The people of this country have given us the mandate to run the government. But every one who has been given a place in the Parliament has been given the responsibility to run the nation. And that is why, it is my firm belief that the people sitting in the government and all the people sitting in the Parliament will work together for taking this country forward, and we will have a very fruitful session. In the last session, a lot of good work was done because of the active participation of the opposition. I believe that this time, too, we will have a similar experience.
