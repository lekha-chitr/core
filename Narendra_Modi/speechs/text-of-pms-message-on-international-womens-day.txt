On International Women’s Day, I salute the indomitable courage and stellar achievements of women. Today, we renew our pledge to make women an equal and integral part of our development journey. My Government has initiated several measures aimed at bringing about a positive change in the lives of women. That is central to our vision of India`s progress and a life of dignity and opportunity for all our citizens. The ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ Yojana seeks to usher in a paradigm shift in attitudes towards the girl child and places emphasis on educating the girl child. The Sukanya Samruddhi Yojana will provide support for marriage and education of young women. MUDRA Bank will help thousands of women achieve financial independence. The Union Budget which has been presented recently, unveils broadbased social security schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Bima Yojana and Atal Pension Yojana. These will benefit women in a big way. Our heads hang in shame when we hear of instances of crime against women. We must walk shoulder-to-shoulder to end all forms of discrimination or injustice against women. The Government is setting up One-Stop-Centres that will provide assistance, legal advice and psychological counselling to women who face violence or abuse. The Government is also commencing a mobile helpline to enable women to dial 181 for access to counselling and referral services. I seek the support of one and all, in transforming our vision into reality.
