Bhilai Steel Plant is a precious gem of Kora of Chhattisgarh Mahtari, the symbol of its prowess. The well knownand popular Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh and my old colleague Dr.Raman Singh ji, my colleague from the Council of Ministers at the centre Chaudhary Birender Singhji, Minister Mr. Manoj Sinha ji, the son of this soil and my colleague at the centreMr.Vishnu Dev Sahayji, the speaker of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly Mr.Gauri Shankar Agarwalji, the ministers of the state government and my dear brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh,
I once again got the opportunity to seekyour blessings. Like today that was also the 14th of the month. Exactly two months ago, on the 14th April, I had launched the first phase of Ayushman Bharat Mission from this soil.
In the history of Chhattisgarh, another golden chapter is being added today to firm up its future. Sometime back, work of expansion and modernisation of Bhilaithe steel plant ,the second airport at Jagdalpur, the launch of new command centre at Raipur and so many other development projects were started. Besides, the development of IIT campus at Bhilai and phase 2 of the Bharat Net in the state were also launched.

I would like to dedicate these projects worth more than Rs.22 thousand crores to my dear brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh today. All these projects will open up new opportunities for employment and education. It will link the remote areas of Chhattisgarh with modern communication technology. Earlier for several years, Bastar was associated with guns, pistols and violence. Today Bastar is known for the airport of Jagdalpur.
Friends,
It is a pleasant and an inspiring experience for us to see the rapid progress of a region that was developed by the vision of Atal Bihari Bajpayeeji and the untiring efforts of the people of Chhattisgarh.
My friend, the Chief Minister Raman Singh jihas carried forward the vision of Atal ji. We often meet or talk over phone. Every time he comes up with a new idea or a scheme with a new hope and enthusiasm. He sounds confident of implementing them successfully.
Friends,
We are well aware of the fact that law, peace and basic necessities of life remain the priority for development. Raman Singh ji, on the one hand stressed upon peace, stability and law and order and on the other , he kept pushing Chhattisgarh forward to scale new heights of development with new ideas and schemes. I congratulate Raman Singh ji and my brothers and sisters of Chhattisgarh for this journey of development.
Brothers and sisters,
This region is not new to me. I used to visit this place on a two-wheeler at a time when Chhattisgarh was not carved out of Madhya Pradesh. I used to come here for organisational work. About 50 of us used to meet. We used to discuss national and societal issues of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and others. From that timeI have a close connection with Chhattisgarh. You have showered so much love upon me. I have always been associated with you. There has not been a single year in the past 20-25 years when I didn't visit Chhattisgarh. There's hardly any district left that I might not have visited. I have got a lot of love from the people here.
Brothers and sisters,
I had been to the Bhilai Steel Plant before coming here. It has been equipped with modern technology and new capacity has been added to itat a cost of more than 18 thousand crore rupees. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to inaugurate this modified modern plant today. Very few people would be aware of the fact that since independence all the tracks that were laid from Kutch to Cuttack and from Kargil to Kanyakumari were the result of hard work of the people mostly from this land. Surely, Bhilai has not only made steel but has also improved the standard of living of the people. The modernised steel plant of Bhilai will strengthen the foundation of New India just like steel. You are well aware that the faces of Bhilai and Durggot a complete face liftbecause of the steel plants. I believe that the steel plant set up at Bastar will also change the lives of the people of that region.
Brothers and sisters,
Mining of iron ore has played a significant role in speeding up the process of development in Chhattisgarh. You, especially my tribal brothers and sisters have the right over it. Therefore, after getting elected we have brought about a key change in the law. We have also decided that a part of the income from the mining will be spent for the development of local people. We have already drafted this law. Therefore, District Mineral Foundation has been set up in every mining district. Subsequently, Chhattisgarh also gained more than Rs. 3000 crore. This amount is now being utilized for setting up hospitals, schools, roads and toilets.

Brothers and sisters,
Skill development is as important as Make in India for development. Bhilai is identified as the country's one of the greatest educational hubs for decades. Despite all these facilities, a need was felt for setting up an IIT. Your Chief Minister Raman Singh had been trying hard to get an IIT established at Bhilai even during the previous government's tenure. However, you know very well about the people who were running the government at that time. After our party came to power it was immediately decided to set up 5 new IITs. Today the IIT campus at Bhilai that was set up with an expenditure of several crore rupees, is being inaugurated. This campus that was built at a cost of about Rs.1100 crores will prove to be a focal point of technology and technical education for the meritorious students of Chhattisgarh and other parts of the country and it will always inspire them to do something new.
Friends,
A few minutes ago, I had got the opportunity to hand over laptops to some youngsters on this stage. I am glad that the Bharatiya Janata Party government is continuously emphasizing upon computer and technology education through SuchnaKrantiYojana. The more we can link the people with technology, the more we can deliver its benefits to them. For the last four years, Digital India is being carried forward with this very vision. The Chhattisgarh government is also engaged in pushing this mission forward and carrying it to every household.
Friends,
The last time when I came here on the birth anniversary of BabasahebAmbedkar, I got the opportunity to launch the Phase 1 of the internet connection program i.e. Bastar Net. Today the work for Bharat Net Phase 2 has also been started. Efforts will be made to complete this project worth about Rs.2500 crores by March next year. About 4000 Panchayats in Chhattisgarh have already been linked to internet. The rest 6000 Panchayats will also be linked by next year.
Friends,
A new foundation for the empowerment of the poor, tribal, oppressed and deprived communities is being laid through Initiatives like Digital India Mission, Bharat Net project, the state government's Sanchar KrantiYojana, distribution of more than 50 lakh smart phones and erection of more than 1200 mobile towers. Digital connectivity is not only linking places but also connecting people.
Brothers and sisters,
Today, a lot of effort is being made to connect the country with water, land and so on. As a result, while the previous governments were hesitant even in construction of roads in certain areas, we have built Airport along with roads. As I already told you that my vision is to ensure that the common man travels by air. Thus, we have started with the UDAN scheme and new airports have been built across the country. A similar airport is being established in your Jagdalpur. Flights have already been started from Jagdalpur to Raipur. Now the distance between Jagdalpur and Raipur can be covered in just 40 minutes rather than 6-7 hours.
Friends,
Today, people prefer to travel more by air than by the AC coaches in trains due the policies of the government. There was a time when only 6 flights used to land in Raipur in one day. Now, about 50 flights land in Raipur airport per day. These new routes will not only reduce the distance from the capital but also promote tourism, trade and business and employment opportunities.
Friends,
Today Chhattisgarh has achieved a new milestone. New Raipur city has become the country's first greenfield smart city. I have got the opportunity to inaugurate the Integrated Command and Control Centre in this episode. Now water, electricity, street lights, sewage and transport of the entire city will be monitored from this centre. These are being operated on the basis of modern technology and data. New Raipur will now serve as an example for other smart cities of the country.
Chhattisgarh that was earlier known for its backwardness and tribal communities and its forests, has got the new identity of a smart city. This is a matter of great pride!
Friends,
Our every scheme is aimed at providing a respectful and secure life to the people of the country. This is one of the major reasons why record-breaking youngsters have joined the mainstream and are associated with the country's development in different parts of the country along with Chhattisgarh in the last four years.
I believe that there is just one answer to violence i.e. development, development and development. The trust generated among people by development can eradicate any kind of violence. Both the NDA led government at the centre and the BJP led government of Chhattisgarh have tried to create an environment of trust through development.
Brothers and sisters,
The last time I visited Chhattisgarh, Gram Swaraj Abhiyan was launched across the country. There has been a positive impact of this mission in the last two months. This mission is particularly meant for the 115 Aspirational districts that are lagging behind in terms of development since independence. It also includes 12 districts of Chhattisgarh. The work is being carried out with a new energy keeping in mind the different dimensions of development. It is being ensured that in villages everyone should have bank accounts, gas connection, electricity connection, LED bulbs and everyone should be vaccinated and insured.
Gram Swaraj Abhiyan has become the greatest medium of public participation. This campaign will also set up a new dimension in the development of Chhattisgarh. You cannot even imagine how the poor and the tribal communities are empowered in such an environment of trust and belief.
In Chhattisgarh, under Jan DhanYojana, bank accounts of more than one crore 30 lakh poor people have been opened. This is the figure just of Chhattisgarh and not of the whole country. A new saga of development has been writtenon the land of Chhattisgarh due to the construction of more than 37 lakh toilets, providing free gas connections to more than 22 lakh poor families, giving loans without guarantee to more than 26 lakh people under Mudra yojana, insurance to more than 60 lakh people at a premium of 90 paise per day and 1 rupee per month as well as by providing the benefit of Pradhan MantriFasalBimaYojana to more than 13 lakh farmers.
Brothers and Sisters,
There were 7 lakh households in Chhattisgarh that were deprived of electricity connection. Under the Pradhan MantriSaubhagyaYojana, almost half the households of Chhattisgarh i.e. about 3.5 lakh households were provided with electricity connection within a year. Almost 1100 such villages that were hitherto not electrified since independence have now been electrified. This light is brightening up development and trust in every household.
Friends,
Our government is also working towards providing a house to every homeless person. In the last four years, more than one crore 15 lakh houses were built in both rural and urban areas. Under Pradhan MantriAwasYojana, the incomplete houses built by the previous governments are also being completed. In Chhattisgarh, about 6 lakh houses have already been constructed. I want to make an announcement particularly for the middle class of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and other parts of the country as we have made an important decision that is going to benefit the middle class. Earlier, interest rates were relaxed for the houses being constructed for the middle class but the area used to be small. There was a demand for increasing the area.
Brothers and sisters,
I am proud to announce that the demand of the public has been met. This means that now interest rates will also be relaxed on houses with larger area. This decision of the government is immensely going to benefit the middle class. Today I have got the opportunity to hand over certificates and cheques to the beneficiaries of the central government and state government schemes like Pradhan MantriMatruVandanaYojana, UjjwalaYojana, Mudra yojana, stand-up India scheme and insurance schemes. My best wishes to these beneficiaries and I pray for their future well-being.
Friends,
These are not merely schemes but a resolution to brighten up the present and the future of the poor, the tribals and the deprived section of the society. Our government is specially focussing upon increasing the income of the people residing in the tribal and backward areas.About two months back I had launched the Van DhanYojana from Bijapur. Van DhanVikaskendras are being opened up for this. It is being ensured that the forest products should get the right price in the market.
The government has also announced in this year's budget that 22 thousand rural markets will be developed. In the initial phase, 5000 markets or haats are being developed. The government is making efforts so that my tribal brothers and farmers can have facilities within 5-6km that will enable them to connect with any of the country's market through technology.
Besides, keeping in mind the welfare of the tribal people, the forest rights act have been enforced in a more stringent manner. In the last four years, about one lakh tribal people and tribal groups have been given land titles of more than 20 lakh acres.
The government has amended a law related to Bamboo. You can now easily sell the bamboo grown on your agricultural fields. This law has provided a new avenue for the forest dwellers of increasing their incomes.
Brothers and sisters,
The government is also working keeping in mind the tribal community's education and self-respect. Ekalavya Model Residential schools are being set up across the country to elevate the level of education in tribal children.
Ekalavya Model Residential schools will be set up in every block where the population of tribal brothers and sisters is either greater than 50% of the total population or at least 20 thousand people of this class are residing.
Besides, a new campaign has been started to make the people aware of the contribution made by the tribal people in the country's independence since 1857. Museums are being set up in different states in the memory of the great tribal freedom fighters.
These schemes that will enhance the economic and social infrastructure of Chhattisgarh will also bring uniformity in economic and social development from Bastar to Sarguja and from Raigarh to Rajnand village. The campaign to end regional uneven in the state will also be completed at a fast pace.
Today while I was going to the Bhilai plant, the way I was welcomed and honoured by the people of Chhattisgarh I became speechless. It looked like the entire country had gathered on the streets of Chhattisgarh. There wouldn't have been any corner of the country that was not showering its blessings on me.It was like a mini India. I am really grateful to the people who have settled here in Bhilai and Durg from across the country for reflecting the country's unity before me and for showering their blessings according to their state's traditions.Whenever I come to Chhattisgarh, some new constructive work is being done. Every time Chhattisgarh sets a new target for itself. Therefore, development takes place at a rapid pace.
Brothers and sisters,
I believe that New Chhattisgarh will pave way for New India in 2022. I believe that with your blessings, the resolution for a New India will definitely be fulfilled. With this hope and expectation, I congratulate you and the Chhattisgarh government. I end my speech here.
Thanks a lot!
