Excellencies,• I am very grateful to you all for sharing your thoughts. All the issues raised today are of interest to all of us.• Your remarks give me a much better flavour of your perceptions and priorities.• India has always been keen to work closely with you to advance your development priorities.• India wishes to be a close partner of the Pacific Islands.• I would wish to announce a number of measures to strengthen this partnership.1. Setting up of a Special Adaptation Fund of $ 1 million:• Climate change is a major issue of concern for Pacific Island Countries.• By setting up this Fund, India would be happy to provide technical assistance and training for capacity building to our Pacific Island Partners.
2. Pan Pacific Islands Project:• Given the distance between the islands and poor connectivity, e-networks are an effective means for coordination.• In keeping with the success achieved in the pan-Africa Project, we propose to develop Pan Pacific Islands Project for telemedicine and tele-education.• We are also working on a solar energy project with the Pacific Islands at the community level. The regional hubs will be developed in the Pacific Islands.3.

Increase in Grant-in-Aid to Pacific Island Countries:• Currently, we provide Grant in Aid of 125 thousand US Dollars annually to each Pacific Island Country for community projects selected by you.• I am happy to announce that we are increasing this aid to $ 200,000 annually. This would be rolled over annually.5. Establish Trade Office in India:• This has been a long time request from you to promote trade between India and Pacific Island Countries.• We are ready to support the setting up of a Trade Office at an existing diplomatic representation in New Delhi.• We shall also provide complimentary space to Pacific Island countries during exhibitions organised by ITPO to showcase your products.• We need to find complementarities in our trade.
