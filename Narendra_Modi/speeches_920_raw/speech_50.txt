My dear brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers,
Four years ago you gave me an opportunity to serve the country with your immense support. It is evident that our government has been successful in leading the country in the right direction, from the fact that you all have come here in such large numbers to shower your blessings in the scorching heat of the sun in the month of May.
Brothers and sisters,
The love and affection shown by you is a result of the satisfaction of the master with his servant. On the completion of 4 years of the NDA Government under the leadership of BJP, this Prime Servant once again bows down to the 125 crore Indians and welcomes you.
Friends,
Today is an important day for the people of Baghpat in West Uttar Pradesh and Delhi NCR. Two major road projects have been dedicated - the first phase of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway and the second Eastern Peripheral Expressway. Rs. 11000 crore was spent on Eastern Peripheral Expressway while about Rs. 850 crore has been spent on the recent part of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway. This entire project costs about Rs. 5000 crores. Today, when I had the opportunity to walk on this new road, I realized that the 14-lane journey is going to make the life of people of Delhi NCR much smoother. A modern technique has been used and concrete has been merged with greenery.
Brothers and sisters,
It took only 18 months to complete this work. Today the 14-lane, 9 kilometre stretch has been inaugurated. However, the 9 kilometre stretch is also of great importance and the people of Patparganj, Mayur Vihar, Gaziabad, Indirapuram, Vaishali and Noida are well aware of it. The second phase of this expressway up to Meerut will also be completed at the same pace like this 9km stretch of road. After its completion, the distance between Meerut and Delhi can be covered in just 40-45 minutes.
Friends,
Delhi NCR is faced with not only traffic jam and congestion but also heavy pollution which is taking a monstrous form every year. One of the major reasons of pollution in Delhi is the vehicles entering Delhi and the subsequent long traffic jams. Taking this problem seriously, our government has planned to lay down expressways around Delhi. It will be done in 2 phases. I got the opportunity to inaugurate its first phase i.e. the Eastern Peripheral Expressway just a moment back.
Brothers and sisters,
This expressway will reduce the number of vehicles entering Delhi by almost 30%. Those vehicles will pass through the outskirts. A system has been created by which not only the large vehicles and trucks but also the 50 thousand cars will not have to enter Delhi. Moreover, the Eastern Peripheral Expressway is the first expressway in the country, which is Access-Controlled Raw Green Field Expressway. This road has been constructed in just 500 days. These 2 massive projects are now ready at your service and are laced with latest technology. The energy needs will also be fulfilled by solar energy. This means, it will save time and fuel and will reduce pollution. It will also be easy now to transport milk, vegetables and grains from Western UP to Delhi.



Brothers and sisters,
Modern Infrastructure plays a significant role in raising the standard of living of the 125 crore people. This opens up the path towards 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'; because infrastructure doesn't discriminate between caste, creed, sect and the rich and the poor. This creates equal opportunities for everyone. Therefore, our government has given main thrust of its attention to infrastructure related to highways, railways, airway, waterway and power.
Friends,
We have spent more than 3 lakh crores in creating more than 28000 kilometres of new highways in the last 4 years. I want you all and my countrymen to hear it carefully. Until 4 years ago, Highways were constructed at the rate of 12km per day. While today, the highways are constructed at the rate of 27km per day. Under the Bharat Mala project, a provision of RS.5 Lakh crore has been made in this year's budget. Under this, highways of about 35 thousand kilometer are being constructed. Moreover, work is being done at an unprecedented rate not only in constructing highways but also in railways. A widespread network of railways is being laid down in areas that were not connected with railway network before. We are doubling up our efforts to change single lines into double lines and metre-gauge to broad-guage. Speed of trains is also being increased. We have removed about 5500 unmanned crossings in the last four years.
Brothers and sisters,
A new UDAN scheme has been launched to make air travel cheaper and to open up new air routes. Last year, about one crore people traveled by airways; this is more than the number of people who traveled in the air-conditioned coaches of the railways. I am telling you the story of the last 4 years. We are working on our dream so that even a person wearing slippers will be able to afford air travel. We are also emphasizing upon utilizing the country's potential in waterways to the optimum level. More than 100 waterways will soon come up across the country. Today Ships are sailing in river Ganga in UP. UP is going to be directly linked to the sea through river Ganga. Soon the large cargo ships will be able to reach the major ports of the country. Just like the river Ganga, a new scheme is being prepared for the river Yamuna.
Friends,
Wherever new transportation systems are being set up, new opportunities for industrial development are also being opened up. Keeping this in mind, we have announced the development of a new Defence industrial corridor in UP in this year's budget. This corridor will extend to Agra, Aligarh, Lucknow, Kanpur, Jhansi and Chitrakoot. These corridors alone will create new jobs for nearly two and a half lakh people.
Friends,
Everything for building a New India is being done on the basis of expectations of the youth and the middle class. Work is progressing at a rapid pace under the Bharat Net Plan for connecting every village of the country with internet. You can clearly see the pace at which our government is working. Just as I have given you the comparative figures for Highway development, I would like to give you another figure which is worth noting. The UPA government led by Congress could manage to connect only 59 or approximately 60 Panchayats with Optical Fibre network in four years of their tenure while we have connected more than 1 lakh Panchayats. On one hand less than 60 villages and on the other more than 1 lakh villages in four years! The country can clearly see how the work is being done. Make in India is giving an impetus to the manufacturing sector. Four years ago, there were only 2 factories for manufacturing cell phones in India. Now see for yourself where we have reached today. You will be glad to know that at that time only 2 factories manufactured mobile phones, while today 120 factories manufacture mobile phones out of which several are located within NCR. It has provided jobs to many youngsters. Some of them might be present here today.
Friends,
The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise or the MSMEs play significant role in manufacturing. The MSME sector provides the largest opportunities for employment after the agricultural sector. In UP there is a network of nearly 50 lakh small enterprises. The centre and the Uttar Pradesh government are working together to further expand these industries. The central government has also given a huge tax relief to the MSME sector. The Uttar Pradesh government has taken a major initiative under Yogi ji. The ‘One District One Product’ scheme is significant in this case. The central government has prepared a road map for its contribution to the UP government's efforts in Skill India Mission, stand-up India and Start-up India Mission and Prime Minister's Employment Generation Scheme.
Friends,
Quality business and trade is possible only when an apt security system is in place. The people of West Uttar Pradesh are witnesses to the situation of the past. Today, under the leadership of Yogi ji, criminals are surrendering to the authority. The criminals are taking vows of not committing any crime in the future. I would like to congratulate both Yogi ji and Manoharlal ji for this. They have done a commendable job in UP and Haryana respectively in improving the law and order situation of both the states. They have linked the criminal tracking system amazingly! Earlier the criminals used to commit a crime here and hid in the other state or vice versa. However, today they have shut down all the paths of the criminals for such mischief. I congratulate both of them.



Brothers and sisters,
We are prioritizing women’s empowerment. 7.5 crore toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission and 4 crore gas connections under Ujjwala Yojana have made the lives of the women easy. 75% of the approximate 13 crore loans have been given to women entrepreneurs under Mudra Yojana. Can anyone imagine that 75% of the 13 crore loans raised is by the daughters, sisters and mothers of our country? In the last four years, we have honoured our women and empowered them.
Friends,
Apart from women, we have also taken several important steps in the past four years such as self-employment or social security for empowering the Dalits, oppressed and backward classes of the country. More than half of the loan was given to the Dalits and backward classes under the Mudra Yojana. The Dalit and women entrepreneurs have also benefited from the Stand-up India mission. It is an honour for our government that we have developed 5 places associated with the life of Babasaheb Ambedkar as Panch-Teerth or 5 centres of pilgrimage.
Friends,
I can assert with my experience that those who are selfish are engaged in politics of crocodile-tears or populist politics. On the other hand, the one who is in reality concerned about the problems of the Dalits, oppressed and the deprived section of the society engages him in welfare politics and not the populist one. Apart from providing opportunities, we have also taken several important decisions for providing justice and safety to my Dalit and backward brothers and sisters in the last four years.
We have made the laws related to atrocities against Dalits and tribals even more stringent. We have extended the list of number of atrocities against Dalits from 22 different crimes to 47. A Special Court is being set up for speedy trial of cases related to atrocities against Dalits.
Brothers and sisters,
We have decided to form a commission for sub-categorization of backward castes. The government wants to provide better facilities of reservation within the framework to those who are even more backward within OBC in the government and educational Institutions. Therefore, we have formed this Commission for sub-categorization of OBCs.
Friends,
The government is also willing to provide a constitutional status to the OBC commission. The OBC community has been demanding it for the past 25 years. But the UPA government didn't bother about it. We have framed the law instead. We have framed important laws in the Parliament to provide constitutional status to the OBC commission. But the Congress and its allies were not supporting it. Therefore, they stood as an obstacle. Therefore, the law is still pending in the Parliament. But I assure the OBC community that the steps taken by Modi will definitely be fulfilled.
Brothers and sisters,
The fact is that Congress and its allies always create obstacles for anything done for the welfare of the poor, the Dalits, backward classes and tribals. They even take the development of the country as a mockery. They take the Swachh Bharat Mission as a joke and the toilets constructed for the poor women as a joke. They even made fun of the fact that our government was providing free gas connections to the poor women. The people with the anti-poor mentality also made fun of the fact that we were providing the poor with bank accounts. These people who are used to nepotism believe that anything done for the poor is a joke. People who tear and throw away the cabinet papers do not believe in showing respect for laws passed by the Parliament with majority.
Today, the people are watching that for political benefits they are blatantly lying even upon the orders of the Supreme Court. They don't even think about the instability that could possibly be created due to their lies. They are spreading rumors and misleading the people about reservation or the laws related to atrocities against the Dalits. I have heard that they are spreading a new lie among the people and probably it has reached the people of this area. They are spreading this rumour among the farmers that 18% GST will be imposed on those farmers who will give his farm on contract or for share-cropping. I request the losing party to put a limit to their dirty politics. Such an extent of spreading lies! They are misleading my country's farmers. You don't know the extent of sin that you are committing. I request my farmer brothers and sisters not to pay any attention to such rumours and should complaint against those spreading these rumours. I promise you that those who spread such lies will be tackled by the law.
Friends,
Our government is working upon the concept of 'Gramoday Se Bharat Uday'. My country's farmers, small workers of the villages and the agricultural labourers are the focus of the concept of 'Gramoday'. A provision of 14 lakh crore Rupees has been made to strengthen the infrastructure related to village and farming in this year's budget.
Moreover, schemes like 100% Neem coating of urea, Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, have benefitted the farmers and given them reassurance. Our government has decided to provide 1.5 times of the support price of the cost to the farmers. I also congratulate both the Chief Ministers for framing laws according to which maximum products will be purchased from the farmers under the new MSE rules. They have broken all the past records. I congratulate both the Chief Ministers and both the governments dedicated to the farmers.
We are working on the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana which is worth an investment of 6000 crores to prevent the wastage of food grains on the way to the markets from the farms. This scheme is going to benefit the potato producing farmers of the west UP the most. In this budget, a new scheme called 'Operation Green' has been announced which is related to new supply chain system. This will prove to be highly beneficial for the farmers producing fruits, flowers and vegetables.
Brothers and sisters,
Modern techniques like organic farming, apiculture, solar farms etc. are being promoted. Detailed schemes are being framed so that the farmers engaged in these sub-sectors of agriculture can easily avail loans.
Our government is also taking steps for the sugarcane farmers. Last year we had increased the support price of sugarcane by about 11%. This directly benefitted 5 crore sugarcane farmers. Making revolutionary changes in the country's ethanol policy, 10% blending of ethanol with petrol has been approved. Recently a major decision has been taken so that the amount due to the sugarcane farmers is not delayed by the sugar Mills. The government has decided to provide a subsidy of Rs.5 and 50 paise per quintal of sugarcane to the sugar mills. But this subsidy will not be given to the owners of the sugar mills. We are well aware of its misuse. Instead of giving the subsidy to the sugar mills, this amount will be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the sugarcane farmers. In this way, the amount meant for the farmers will not be stuck with the sugar mills. I want to assure the sugarcane farmers here that the government is sensitive towards their problems and is committed to resolving them with stringent measures.
Brothers and sisters,
We are also preparing our cities for the 21st century along with the development of our villages. The infrastructure of the cities is being strengthened with schemes like Smart Cities Mission and AMRIT Yojana. We are making extensive efforts so as to provide houses to the lower and middle income classes living in the cities. We are progressing at a rapid pace in this area compared to the Congress governments. In 10 years i.e. between 2004 and 2014, approximately 13.5 lakh houses were approved for construction in the urban areas whereas in the last four years we have approved 46 lakh houses and have reached almost 50 lakhs. We have done 3 times more work than the Congress. Congress had handed over the keys of 5.5 lakh houses in 10 years in urban areas whereas our government has handed over the keys of more than 8 lakh houses in urban areas within 4 years.
Brothers and sisters,
Urban infrastructure is also being prepared to handle the challenges of growing population. We have seen that 38 years of rule by a single family has led to unplanned growth in urban areas. We know where the problem lies. There was no proper system of removing the sewer from the cities or for water treatment. Our rivers are carrying garbage from the cities and depositing them in the seas. Our mother Ganga, in particular, is bearing the brunt of growing population and industrial pollution. Therefore, our government has started the Namami Gange programme. The government has not only emphasized upon cleanliness of Ganges but also is trying to ensure that no garbage is dumped into the river. So far, more than 200 projects of about 21000 crore Rupees have been approved by the government. Besides, Villages located on the banks of river Ganga are being made Open Defecation Free on a priority basis. Several villages of the 5 states viz. Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal through which mother Ganges flows, have been successful in this mission.
Friends,
Several major Initiatives have been taken for cleaning the Ganga in the past. However, this government not merely talks about things but works to prove it. This is our work culture. This is our capital. We are ensuring that every penny of the public's hard earned money is spent on them. Therefore, we are trying to ensure that the sewage treatment plants that are being constructed should work properly because it was the culture of the Congress to construct sewage treatment plants that didn't work up to its maximum capacity. Moreover, those stopped working after a short span of time. Efforts are being made to remove this Congress culture from the projects related to mother Ganga.
Friends,
It is being ensured that the plants that are being built will work keeping in mind the needs that will arise 15 years later. Thus, our aim is not only to construct sewage treatment plants but also to run them smoothly.
Brothers and sisters,
Those who have deceived the country's poor, middle class, farmers and youth for 70 years have become frustrated to see the people's trust on the NDA government. This huge wave of people after four years is giving them sleepless nights. The fact is that they neither trusted the country's democracy nor the institutions under the constitution. Their mentality has been revealed completely in the last four years. The country has seen in the last few days how they have threatened the faith in the apex court.
The country is well aware of how they had questioned the Election Commission of India and the EVMs. They have also questioned the Reserve Bank of India and their policies. They have committed the sin of creating a crisis of faith in these Institutions. They are also questioning the agencies that are investigating their scams. Moreover, they even consider the media as biased.
Brothers and sisters,
Those who are worshippers of that one family can never worship democracy. They have even failed to acknowledge the courage of the Indian army during the surgical strike. When international agencies praise India, they cannot even digest that. They even question the same agencies that produced statistics for their government and are providing new statistics for the present government showing its better performance. They question and criticize even when a foreign guest comes and praises India.



Friends,
You and I know the cause of their frustration very well. It is quite obvious to be frustrated when the people lose trust in them. However, I didn't expect them to oppose the country while opposing Modi. But when someone has your faith and blessings i.e. the blessings of 125 Crore Indians then he will never get tired or stop ever.
Friends, my countrymen,
You can evaluate both the sides yourself. On that side are the people for whom their family is their country, while for me the country is my family. The 125 crore people of this country are my family members. I just have your blessings, love and trust to earn. I just have one work which is, serving the 125 crore countrymen. Our resolution of 'Shreshtha Bharat' will be strengthened by your cooperation. I thank you for coming here in such large numbers. The road that has been inaugurated today is an example of what the 21st century India will look like. Its significance is thus not limited to this area alone.
Thanks a lot!
