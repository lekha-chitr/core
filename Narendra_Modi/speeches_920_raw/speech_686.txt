At the core of Dr. Ambedkar's ideals is harmony and togetherness: PM Modi
Working for the poorest of the poor is the Government’s mission, says PM Modi

The Honourable speaker,Madam SumitraJi, my colleagues in the council of ministers, Shri Anant Kumar Ji, ShrimanHardeep Singh PuriJi, the chairperson of the House Committee Shriman, Suresh AngadiJi, all the honourable members of Parliament present here,
Tai Ji hasjust said about taking the Prime Minister’s time for such a small event; But, I don’t think that it’s a small event. It’s not a small event because you have worked with dedication to complete this task. When people watch the visuals of Parliament on television, they would see that Madam Speaker is pulling up the MPs, asking themto go back to their seats. Sometimes people would feel that the MPs are irritatingMadam Speaker. They would have been watching SumitraJi sitting like a mother on the chair and these five hundred people in the House troubling her.



Today the country will also see the kind natureof a mother, her concern for the MPs when they face problems.And because of her motherly concern for them that this building has been constructed. These appropriate arrangements have been made for the guests of the MPs and also for the newly elected MPs.
People will feel that Madam Speaker comes forward not just tomaintain discipline in the House but also to take care of all the MPs. Her concern for the MPs is like that of a mother for her children..
Therefore, attendingsuch program is a matter of great luck.Members of both the Houses of Parliament including me are grateful to you because you have created this facility for our family of MPs.
Generally,the work done by government departments is considered worse than that of a contractor. However, one would realise once a government agency decides to do a good job it is capable of doing it and that it can execute in time and with the budgeted amount.
All these things have been done by HardeepJi’s department in a proper manner. Therefore I convey my sincere congratulations to all those officers of the department who have worked hard.



Today, a grand thing is annexed with our Parliamentary system. This is an historic place.Those who have read the records of 1926knowLalaLajpatRaiJi used to stay here,MotilalJi Nehru used to stay here. You would get the opportunity to connect with such a heritageplace. I am sure that a good work has been done in this system.
And as Tai Ji has said that we are the kind of people who inaugurate the facilities the foundations for which were laid by us. And today you would have seen this thing that we have done it before the deadline. I think the project has been completed and delivered 4 to 6 months ahead of the schedule.
When new MPs come here theyhave to stay in five star hotelsspending a lot of money. This is because MPs who have not contested the election or have not been re-elected by the people do not vacate their house. As a result, newly elected MPs are required to stay in hotels.
You have done a great service to the MPs. The newly elected MPs will now come and stay here instead of staying in hotels and it will also remove the burden on the government exchequer. So in a way this facility will not just provide convenience, but will also bring respect to the newly elected MPs.
Mycolleagues ShrimanMeghwalJi and Shriman Suresh Ji, and as the speaker madam informed that both of them have worked on this project with full dedication. My colleague Mr. Rudi also took great interest in this. I felt that because it was constructed for MPs Ialso used to apply my mind to it. I don’t have much knowledge about architecture but Mr.Rudi was very enthusiastic about it so he used to come up with new ideas. However, it’s very natural for everyone to be happy after seeing that it has been materialized.
You would be aware that there are two such places in Delhi which were planned to be constructed in the memory of Doctor Baba SahebAmbedkar during the government of AtalJi. However, when the governments were being run then they had been run in this manner that everybody rushed to do the politics in the name of Baba SahebAmbedkar.
Those decisions which were taken during the tenure ofAtalJi were not implemented. However, we completed them within the stipulated time after forming the government.
And second thing, when I laid itsfoundation I said that I would dedicate this to publicin April 2018. And today I’m happy to inform that on the eve of Baba SahebAmbedkar’s birth anniversary on14th of Aprilwe will dedicate the house onAlipur Road where he lived to public on 13th of April.
There is some respect, there are some ideals and there is a commitment which run in our veins. And we have demonstrated this through our deeds. Perhaps no other government would have given this kind of respect and honourand paid tributes to Baba SahebAmbedkar which have been given by this government. And instead of dragging Baba Saheb into politics if all of us would try to follow the path shown by Baba SahebAmbedkarwhich places importance on brotherhood and we can never progress by abandoning that.
We have moved forward by following the motto of SabkaSath-SabkaVikas for the welfare of everyone and we are the people who live and die for the rights of the last man in the society.
And throughout our lives we follow these things as Mahatma Gandhi had shown this path to us that we should be first concerned about the last man in the society. And it is the responsibility of the government. And the government has been discharging its duty.
I once again heartily congratulate this entire team and convey my best wishes to all of you.
Thank you.
