Welcome friends,  All of us are back together once again after the recess during the Budget Session of the Parliament. There will be detailed discussion on the Budget and I am sure the level of debate and discussion will be of good quality. It will be focused on the issues pertaining to the welfare of the poor. We are hopeful of a breakthrough in the GST. One of the reasons for our optimism is that all the states have cooperated in a positive manner. All the political parties have also been extremely positive and cooperative in their response. We have been able to move forward in this direction after arriving at a consensus on certain decisions subsequent to detailed discussion on this issue in a democratic manner. The efforts are on to enlist the co-operation of  all to ensure that GST is in place by this session. I am extremely thankful to all of you once again.
